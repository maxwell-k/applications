[![reuse compliant](https://reuse.software/badge/reuse-compliant.svg)](https://reuse.software/)

This directory helps the author understand changes to software that he uses.

It uses Ansible to install JavaScript and Python packages. The versions of these
packages are pinned and updated with [renovate]. Where possible each installed
binary is run with `--version`, or equivalent, to test the installation.

Each package uses a separate `main.yaml` to account for variations between
packages for example multiple binaries, the absence of support for `--version`
or a non-zero return code.

Packages are installed with `npm ci` or `pip`. Installation is tested on in
GitLab CI on recent versions of Alpine Linux, Debian and Ubuntu.

On Alpine Linux the repository does not compile C code. Instead the playbooks
pull in system packages.

# Quick start

## Use a package

```sh
ansible-playbook -i, packages/jsonlint/main.yaml
```

## Setup a new Node.js package

Using `jsonlint` as an example, create the playbook and then try to run it. This
will fail because it doesn't install the binaries without a `package-lock.json`
so it cannot run the binaries. Instead create a `package-lock.json` with
`npm install`.

```sh
ansible-playbook -i, create-npm.yaml -e create_package=jsonlint
ansible-playbook -i, packages/jsonlint/main.yaml
cd /opt/jsonlint
npm install
```

Move the resulting `package-lock.json` into this repository and use the package
again. Add a line to `site.yaml`.

## Setup a new Python package

The main task is to create a suitable `requirements.txt`. Using `autopep8` as an
example:

```
mkdir packages/autopep8 &&
cd packages/autopep8 &&
cp ../black/main.yaml . &&
echo autopep8 > requirements.in &&
pip-compile &&
cd ../.. &&
ansible-playbook -i, packages/autopep8/main.yaml
```

For `pip-compile` on Alpine Linux to succeed it may help to have `alpine-sdk`
and `py3-wheel` installed.

`pre_tasks` that install Alpine Linux packages with the `apk` Ansible module do
not have `become: yes` set because when:

1. running on CI, `ansible-playbook` will be run as root
2. running locally, with tags like `@testing` in `/etc/apk/repositories` the
   pre-task will fail unless the packages are already installed.

# Checks

A pre-commit hook checks that `site.yaml` is up to date:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

# Choice of renovate

Rhys Arkins, the author of renovate spoke on the [Changelog Episode 289].
Renovate is licensed with the GNU Affero General Public License version 3

Both dependabot and renovate appear to offer similar functionality, but renovate
is open source.

# Variables

In the two roles, `npm` and `pip` the following variables are used:

- `???_name` is the name of the folder containing `main.yaml` and the lock files
- `???_binaries` is a list of the binaries to link from `/usr/local/bin/`,
  defaults to the role name
- `???_versions` is a list of the binaries that the role will run with
  `--version`, defaults to `npm_binaries`
